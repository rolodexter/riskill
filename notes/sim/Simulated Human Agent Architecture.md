## **Simulated Human Agent Architecture**

**Key Concepts We've Established:**

**1. "Minimum Viable Human" Approach**

- Exactly the profile depth required for legitimate enterprise SaaS provisioning
- Name, email, department, title, phone (for 2FA)
- **Avoids** personal backstories, anthropomorphic behaviors, emotional expressions

**2. Dynamic Persona Generation**

- Agents start as generic "Riskill AI Agent"
- Develop personalized identities through **~5-minute onboarding conversations**
- Context-driven emergence (Adam Draper, Sarah Chen, Marcus Rodriguez, Dr. Jennifer Walsh)

**3. Universal SaaS Compatibility**

- **Simulated human agents** navigate any platform as legitimate users
- Solves the API integration complexity problem
- Gets provisioned like any employee with proper permissions

**Technical Advantage:**

```
Traditional Approach: Complex API integrations + permission headaches
Riskill Approach: "Hire" AI analyst → Gets user account → Works everywhere
```

**Enterprise Integration Benefits:**

- Seamless Active Directory/Google Workspace provisioning
- Legitimate system access across all platforms
- Natural permission structures that match business context
- Compliance-ready audit trails

In the context of our **interface demo**, this becomes the foundation for the **Riskill AI Agent Card** in the left zone - where executives interact with their "hired" business intelligence analyst rather than configuring software.
