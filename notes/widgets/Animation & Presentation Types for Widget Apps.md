Here is a directory of common animation and progressive disclosure patterns you can use to present, reveal, or enhance the content in widget "apps" for dashboards and interfaces. These techniques both improve user engagement and can manage cognitive load, especially in small UI components.

## Animation & Presentation Types for Widget Apps

## 1. Entrance/Exit Animations

- **Fade In/Out:** Smoothly increase or decrease a widget’s opacity[1](https://app.convertful.com/docs/widgets/animated-widgets-elements/)[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **Slide In/Out:** Move the widget into or out of view from a direction (left, right, top, bottom)[1](https://app.convertful.com/docs/widgets/animated-widgets-elements/)[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **Scale (Grow/Shrink):** Change the widget’s size for appearance or focus, often used for modal popups or buttons[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/)[3](https://help.hcl-software.com/voltmx/v9.5/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Animation.html).
    
- **3D Flip or Rotate:** Rotate the widget or its content along any axis, commonly used in card-flip UIs[1](https://app.convertful.com/docs/widgets/animated-widgets-elements/)[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **Pulse:** Periodically enlarges/reduces size or changes intensity (attention animation)[1](https://app.convertful.com/docs/widgets/animated-widgets-elements/).
    
- **Shake:** Brief movement to signal errors or interactiveness[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    

## 2. Progressive Disclosure Patterns

- **Accordions:** Sections expand/collapse to show or hide content; ideal for FAQs and dense lists[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure)[5](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-progressive-disclosure/)[6](https://uxplanet.org/design-patterns-progressive-disclosure-for-mobile-apps-f41001a293ba).
    
- **Tabs:** Content segmented into tabs, displayed one at a time[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure)[5](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-progressive-disclosure/).
    
- **Dropdowns and Popovers:** Hover or click reveals menus or more detailed content[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure)[6](https://uxplanet.org/design-patterns-progressive-disclosure-for-mobile-apps-f41001a293ba).
    
- **Carousels/Sliders:** Users swipe or click to cycle through panels or images[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure).
    
- **Scrolling/Auto-scroll:** Gradually reveals more content as user moves or on timed triggers[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure).
    
- **Tooltips/Overlays:** Informational popouts on hover, focus, or tap, often contextual[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure)[5](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-progressive-disclosure/).
    
- **Conditional Display:** Extra actions, links, or metrics appear only after certain triggers (click, hover, completion)[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure)[5](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-progressive-disclosure/).
    

## 3. Content Animation Effects

- **Blur/Saturate/Desaturate:** Create focus or de-emphasize elements[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **Shimmer:** Animated sheen highlights loading or in-progress content (common for skeleton loaders)[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **Tint/Highlight:** Overlay color or visual highlight for focus/selection events[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **Tilt/3D Perspective:** Subtle dimensional movement/rotation on user interaction[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **Animated Sorting/Filtering:** Re-ordering and filtering list/grid items with smooth transitions[7](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/animation)[8](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations).
    

## 4. Complex/Combinatorial Animations

- **Staggered Animation:** Animate widget children sequentially for a cascading effect (e.g., list item reveals one after another)[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **Shared Element/“Hero” Transition:** Animate a widget (like a tile or card) into its expanded state for detail views[8](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations).
    
- **Timeline or Keyframe Animation:** Animate multiple property changes in sequence or at specific points in an interval[9](https://docs.kony.com/konylibrary/visualizer/viz_widget_prog_guide/Content/Animation.htm)[3](https://help.hcl-software.com/voltmx/v9.5/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Animation.html).
    
- **Physics-based Animation:** Use spring, bounce, or inertia simulation for realistic movement when dragging or revealing content[8](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations)[10](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/animation/physics-simulation)[3](https://help.hcl-software.com/voltmx/v9.5/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Animation.html).
    

## 5. Presentation/Interaction Triggers

- **On Load:** Animate when widget enters the view or first renders[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **On Action:** Animate in response to taps, clicks, submissions, completion of tasks, or other user input[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- **On Hover/Focus:** Animate on mouse hover or focus for web and desktop; tap for mobile[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure).

|Carousel|Show panels/images one at a time|Product showcases, stories|
|Physics-based Motion|Realistic, springy UI movement|Drag/drop cards, widget snaps|

## Notes

- Most animation and progressive disclosure patterns can be combined for richer, interactive experiences.
    
- Advanced frameworks (Flutter, React, modern web) offer built-in support for many of these techniques; details and properties (duration, easing curves, delay, etc.) can be tailored for maximum polish[7](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/animation)[8](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations)[2](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/animations/widget-animations/).
    
- Progressive disclosure isn’t just about motion, but about _sequencing complexity_ so users see the right content at the right time[4](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure)[5](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-progressive-disclosure/)[11](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/).
    

This directory should help you design expressive and user-friendly widget-based apps with both minimalist reveals and high-fidelity, animated interactivity.
