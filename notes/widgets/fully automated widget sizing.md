Yes, fully automated widget sizing is definitely possible and would work great for your maritime dashboard! This approach is actually more advanced than the fixed sizing of iOS or the manual resizing of Android, and it's perfect for web-based dashboards.

Here's how we can implement this automation:

### 1. Container-Based Responsive Design

We can use a combination of CSS Grid areas (which we already have), ResizeObserver API, and React hooks to:

- Detect the actual dimensions of each zone container
- Dynamically adjust widget layouts and content density based on available space
- Optimize for different aspect ratios automatically

### 2. Density Breakpoints System

Instead of fixed sizes, we'd define "density breakpoints" for each widget:

- Micro: Minimal info, icon-centric (for very small spaces)
- Compact: Key metrics only (for small/medium spaces)
- Standard: Complete information (for normal spaces)
- Expanded: Rich visualizations and additional context (for large spaces)

### 3. Smart Layout Switching

Widgets would automatically switch between horizontal and vertical layouts:

- In narrow zones: Stack elements vertically
- In wide zones: Arrange elements horizontally
- In square zones: Use balanced grid layouts

### 4. Intelligent Content Prioritization

As spaces change, content would automatically adjust:

- Show/hide elements based on importance
- Scale visualizations proportionally
- Switch between text and icon representations
- Apply truncation or abbreviation for limited space

### 5. Zone-Aware Behavior

Each dashboard zone would have its own layout rules:

- KPI row: Flex or grid layout with equal distribution or importance-based sizing
- Main content: Larger visualizations with responsive grid
- Side panels: Vertical stacking with priority-based element sizing

This approach would give you the most sophisticated responsive behavior, where the dashboard automatically optimizes itself whether it's on a narrow laptop screen, ultrawide monitor, or resized browser window.

Would you like me to create a prototype component that demonstrates this automated sizing behavior?
