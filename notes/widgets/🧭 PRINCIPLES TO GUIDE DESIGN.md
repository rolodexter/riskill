You're thinking exactly in the right direction. Let’s design the Riskill AI UI layout from **first principles**, based on your goals: high **insight density**, clear **actionability**, and optional **AI-powered interaction**.

Here’s a structured, high-leverage way to approach the UI layout process:

---

## 🧭 PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE DESIGN

|Principle|Description|
|---|---|
|**Insights > Data**|Prioritize actionable insights over raw metrics. Every visual should lead to a judgment or suggestion.|
|**Actionable > Informative**|If the system can recommend or automate next steps, those should be visible first.|
|**Context-aware**|UI should reflect what pillar(s) are active and what modules are unlocked.|
|**Conversational Optionality**|AI agent panel should be available to support queries, exploration, and drill-downs.|
|**Progressive Detail**|High-level summary first, with ability to expand into layered detail (e.g. time series, correlation graphs, raw data).|

## 🧱 PROPOSED LAYOUT STRUCTURE

You can build the UI using this **3-level hierarchy** of **Zones → Panels → Blocks**:

### 🔲 **Zone-Based UI Structure**

|Zone|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Top Zone (Header + KPIs)**|High-level health metrics (MRR, CAC, NPS, Burn) + status indicators|
|**Left Sidebar (Optional)**|Pillar/module selector, filters, alerts, account access|
|**Main Canvas (Center)**|Dynamic insight panels based on active modules|
|**Right Panel (AI Assistant)**|Optional AI chat agent for granular exploration|
|**Bottom Zone (Timeline / Audit)**|Scrollable audit of alerts, past actions, trend pivots|

---

### 🧩 **Panel-Based Composition (Main Canvas)**

1. **AI Highlights Panel**
    
    - “Today’s Top Insight”
        
    - Short narrative: _“ROAS on SKU-A fell 37% — pause campaign?”_
        
    - CTA buttons: _[Dismiss]_ [Investigate]*
        
2. **Anomaly Feed**
    
    - Each row = correlation breach or rule trigger
        
    - Icons for data source, impacted pillar, etc.
        
3. **Opportunities Panel**
    
    - Upsell, margin unlock, churn rescue suggestions
        
    - Confidence score + estimated impact
        
4. **Trend Canvas**
    
    - Switchable charts for key unlocked KPIs
        
    - Benchmark lines and smart annotations
        
5. **Module Tabs (Optional)**
    
    - Users can pin active modules to tabbed view
        
    - e.g. [Cost Watchtower] [Growth Pulse] [Churn Radar]

### 💬 **AI Chat Assistant Panel**

|Capability|Description|
|---|---|
|**Ask anything**|“What changed in CAC after Product X launched?”|
|**Why did this happen?**|Chain-of-causality reasoning across pillars|
|**Simulate outcome**|“What happens to MRR if we cut AdSpend 20%?”|
|**Generate actions**|“Draft 3 tasks based on today’s anomalies.”|
|**Drill into source**|“Show me the 5 accounts behind today’s churn spike.”|

## 🔁 SUGGESTED UI DESIGN WORKFLOW

1. **Define Key Panels**
    
    - Start with 3–5 fixed core panels (Insights, Anomalies, KPIs, AI Assistant, Module Tabs)
        
2. **Wireframe Layout**
    
    - Use Miro or Figma to sketch rows and columns (header, left, right, main canvas, bottom timeline)
        
3. **Map Module → Panel Triggers**
    
    - For each module, define what it unlocks visually: insight card, chart, AI skill, etc.
        
4. **Draft Component Library**
    
    - Cards, buttons, insight blocks, data source tags, CTA chips — all atomic components
        
5. **Implement AI Agent Hooks**
    
    - Decide if AI is on-page (live panel) or modal (expandable overlay)
        
6. **Run Simulated UX**
    
    - Write "day in the life" flows of how a founder or ops lead would use it

## 💡 WHAT’S MISSING IN PRIOR ITERATIONS (That We Can Add)

|Missing Element|How to Add It|
|---|---|
|**AI Agent**|Always-available right panel or collapsible drawer|
|**Module-aware Panels**|Dynamically show/hide panels based on pillar/module unlock|
|**Action Buttons**|Show CTA buttons with pre-baked actions (Slack push, task draft, alert snooze)|
|**User Query Memory**|Let AI remember what user asked yesterday — improve follow-ups|
|**Insight Variants**|Let users toggle between narrative, chart, or causal graph for an insight|
