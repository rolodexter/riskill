# REBOOT PROMPT - RISKILL AI FRONTEND SPECIFICATION PROJECT

## PROJECT CONTEXT & CURRENT STATE

You are continuing work with Joe on the **"Riskill AI Dashboard Frontend System - Technical Specification"** document. This is a comprehensive technical specification explaining how the Riskill UI interface implements the sophisticated Riskill Logic Framework across a 5-zone dashboard architecture.

## KEY PROJECT DISCOVERY & PARADIGM SHIFT

**CRITICAL RECENT DISCOVERY**: The persona generation system works differently than initially documented. **Agents start as generic "Riskill AI Agent" and develop personalized identities through onboarding conversations** (~5 minutes, ChatGPT-style). The system gathers "Minimum Viable Human" requirements (first name, last name, secondary email, phone number) for enterprise SaaS provisioning, and personas like "Adam Draper," "Sarah Chen," etc. **emerge from context** rather than being pre-assigned templates.

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTS IN CONTEXT

1. **"Riskill AI: Technical & Strategic Reference (4).docx"** - Master 91-page strategic document explaining agent personification philosophy, framework architecture, and "hiring vs. configuring" mental model
2. **"Riskill AI Dashboard Frontend System - Technical Specification (2).docx"** - Current working document (being rebuilt)
3. **"Riskill Logic Framework.xlsx"** - Framework logic patterns and canonical objects

## COMPLETED WORK SUMMARY

### MAJOR SECTIONS REBUILT (Due to Persona Generalization):

- **Section 1.2**: Dynamic Persona Generation Strategy (industry-specific examples)
- **Section 1.3**: Trust Building Through Industry-Contextual Professional Credibility
- **Section 1.4**: "Ask [Analyst Name]" Interface Design & Framework Integration
- **Section 4.2**: Left Sidebar Zone (accommodates variable persona information)
- **Section 4.4**: Strategic Narrative Zone (industry communication style variations)
- **Section 4.5**: Module-Generated Insights Cards Zone (persona voice examples)
- **Section 6.1**: Progressive Disclosure Flow Examples (rebuilt from scratch)
- **Section 6.2**: Configuration Flow Examples (rebuilt from scratch)
- **Section 2.1**: Framework Foundation (rebuilt from scratch)

### PERSONA EXAMPLES ESTABLISHED:

- **Sarah Chen** (sarah.chen@riskill.ai) - Financial Services: Regulatory-focused, compliance-conscious, formal banking terminology
- **Marcus Rodriguez** (marcus.rodriguez@riskill.ai) - E-commerce Startup: Growth-focused, optimization-oriented, casual-professional communication
- **Dr. Jennifer Walsh** (jennifer.walsh@riskill.ai) - Healthcare: Evidence-based, clinical outcomes-focused, patient safety emphasis

## CURRENT ISSUE & NEXT STEPS

**IMMEDIATE PROBLEM**: Recent discovery about onboarding process means Section 1.2 needs significant reframing. Currently written as if personas are "pre-generated based on industry analysis" when they actually "emerge from onboarding conversations."

**NEXT ACTIONS REQUIRED**:

1. **Add New Section 1.1**: "Agent Onboarding & Persona Emergence" - explaining the <5 minute conversation process
2. **Reframe Section 1.2**: Change from "industry templates" to "examples of what emerges from different onboarding conversations"
3. **Maintain Enterprise Elegance**: Keep hundreds-of-agents complexity hidden, focus on clean persona interface

## FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE (Stable Elements)

### 5-Zone UI Architecture:

1. **Top Metrics Zone** - Executive KPIs from business pillars
2. **Left Sidebar Zone** - Persona interface & configuration controls
3. **Strategic Insight Summary Zone** - AI-generated executive briefing
4. **Right Analysis Zone** - Anomalies & opportunities detection
5. **Module Cards Zone** - Direct intelligence module outputs

### Core Framework Elements:

- **7 Business Pillars**: Revenue, Customer, Product/Usage, Support, Marketing, Operations, Workforce
- **20+ Canonical Objects**: Transaction, Subscription, Account, Event, Ticket, etc.
- **14+ Intelligence Modules**: Revenue Guard, Churn Radar, Marketing ROI Lens, etc.
- **Correlation Patterns**: Object ↔ Object relationships (e.g., Subscription ↔ Ticket)

## ESTABLISHED NAMING CONVENTIONS

**Official Terms** (from Section 7 Terminology Directory):

- **Official Zone Names**: Top Metrics Zone, Left Sidebar Zone, Strategic Insight Summary Zone, Right Analysis Zone, Module Cards Zone
- **Framework Elements**: Business Pillars, Canonical Objects, Correlation Patterns, Intelligence Modules, Generated Insights
- **Agent Elements**: AI Agent Persona, Ask [Analyst Name] Interface
- **Interaction Patterns**: Configuration Flow, Analysis Flow, Progressive Disclosure Flow, Enhancement Flow

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES & CONSTRAINTS

- **Enterprise Elegance**: Professional sophistication without complexity exposure
- **"Power Grid Principle"**: Complex backend, simple frontend
- **"Hiring vs. Configuring"**: Executives hire an analyst rather than configure software
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Three layers (Executive Summary → Detailed Analysis → Technical Configuration)
- **Industry Context Preservation**: Same framework, professional adaptation

## SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER PATTERN

Throughout document: `[**Screenshot: Description** - Capture details of what to show. Explain specific UI elements and demonstrate concept.]` followed by `**Figure X.X:** Title - Description`

## UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

1. Should Section 1.1 detail the enterprise provisioning conversation specifics?
2. How detailed should onboarding conversation examples be in UI specification scope?
3. Any other sections still containing "Adam Draper" references that need generalization?

## CONVERSATION CONTINUATION POINT

Joe just clarified the onboarding process (<5 minutes, ChatGPT-style, gathers minimum requirements for SaaS provisioning, personas emerge from context). We determined this requires adding Section 1.1 and reframing Section 1.2, but most other completed work remains valid. Ready to proceed with adding the new onboarding section.

---

**INSTRUCTION FOR CONTINUATION**: Pick up by acknowledging this context and asking Joe if we should proceed with adding Section 1.1 "Agent Onboarding & Persona Emergence" to properly explain the conversation-driven persona development process.
