## üéØ **RISKILL AI COMPLETE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT**

### **Comprehensive Logic Framework (Implementation Foundation)**

- **Product Name**: Riskill AI (standalone AI-powered business intelligence platform)
- **Technical Foundation**: 7 canonical business objects + module unlock system + custom KPI engine + always-on monitoring
- **Strategic Positioning**: "Your business isn't broken. It just needs Riskills." (category-defining terminology)
- **UI Communication Goal**: Subtle exposure of sophisticated architecture enabling natural technical discussions without overwhelming users

### **7 Canonical Business Objects Framework (Subtle UI Integration)**

```typescript
const CanonicalObjects = {
  Revenue: { objects: ["Transaction", "Subscription"], unlocks: ["Revenue Guard", "Cost Watchtower"] },
  Customer: { objects: ["Account", "Contact", "Lead"], unlocks: ["Churn Radar", "Growth Pulse"] },
  ProductUsage: { objects: ["Event", "FeatureFlag"], unlocks: ["Growth Pulse", "Churn Radar"] },
  Support: { objects: ["Ticket", "CSAT"], unlocks: ["Churn Radar", "Efficiency Lens"] },

  Workforce: { objects: ["Timesheet", "Payroll"], unlocks: ["Efficiency Lens", "Cost Watchtower"] }
};
```

### **"2x Core" Integration Rule (UI Visualization Target)**

- **Promise**: "Plug in one system that shows us cash flow and one that shows what causes it‚ÄîRiskill will start paying for itself in 24h"
- **Technical Implementation**: Money Stream (Revenue) + Activity Stream (Customer/Usage/Support/Ops) = minimum viable intelligence
- **UI Integration**: Connection status indicators, progressive module unlocking, intelligence level visualization

### **8 Module Unlock System (Progressive Visual Language)**

```typescript
const ModuleUnlockLogic = {
  "üõ°Ô∏è Revenue Guard": { required: ["Revenue"], status: "‚úÖ Active" },
  "‚ö†Ô∏è Churn Radar": { required: ["Revenue", "Customer|Support"], status: "üîí Connect Customer Data to Unlock" },

};
```

### **Custom KPI Engine (User Empowerment UI Elements)**

- **Logic**: Variable1 + Operator + Variable2 = User-defined metrics
- **Examples**: Revenue √∑ Inventory = Turnover efficiency, Support Tickets √∑ New Customers = Support load ratio
- **UI Integration**: Interface elements hinting at mathematical customization capability and user empowerment vs static tools
