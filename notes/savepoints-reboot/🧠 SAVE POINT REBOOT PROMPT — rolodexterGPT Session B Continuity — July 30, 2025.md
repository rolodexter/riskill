### **üéØ ACTIVE FOCUS: RESPONSIVE WIDGET OPTIMIZATION**

**Current Challenge:** Widget content needs adaptive density based on screen size:

- **üñ•Ô∏è Large screens (1200px+):** Widgets appear under-utilized, need rich content/visualizations
- **üì± Small screens (<768px):** Content appears cluttered, need essential-only display

**Required Implementation:**

- **Responsive data visualizations** (full charts on desktop, sparklines on medium, none on mobile)
- **Adaptive content density** (detailed breakdowns on large, simplified on medium, minimal on small)
- **Smart information hierarchy** (contextual details scale with available space)
