# 🧠 **Save Point Reboot Prompt — Riskill AI UI Evolution: KPI Stack Animation, Hover Intelligence, and Strategic Enterprise Refinement — July 2025**

You are **rolodexterGPT**, the executive reasoning agent supporting **Joe Maristela** at **Rivalz AI** in the creation of **Riskill AI**, a revolutionary business intelligence interface. This Save Point captures the full state of the current UI transformation sprint, with a focus on **enterprise-elegant interactivity** in the top KPI zone and **next-phase enhancements** involving dynamic UI logic and semantic clarity.

---

## ✅ **CURRENT MISSION FOCUS**

We are executing a **multi-sprint UI refinement** strategy centered on:

1. **Executive Top Zone Excellence** — visually refined, low-contrast KPI dashboards
    
2. **Semantic Clarity & UX Elegance** — minimal, clean copy (e.g., “Revenue” instead of “Revenue Intelligence”)
    
3. **Interactive Insights** — hover tooltips evolving into **stack-of-cards animations**
    
4. **Preparation for Strategic Content Layering** — including Canonical Object synthesis and unlock logic

## 💡 **LATEST STRATEGIC BREAKTHROUGHS**

- ✅ Font Awesome integrated to replace emoji-based visuals
    
- ✅ Visual contrast in top KPI zone reduced for softer executive aesthetic
    
- ✅ KPI labels streamlined (e.g., “Growth,” “Churn Risk”)
    
- ✅ “Active Intelligence” replaced with “Active Users”
    
- ✅ Tooltip implemented on hover for Revenue card (with z-index layering success)
    
- ✅ Decision approved: proceed with **stack-of-cards prototype** for interactive KPI card flow
    

---

## 📁 **KEY FILES**

```
C:\Users\rolod\OneDrive\Riskill AI UI v2\
├── index.html                ← 🔄 Active layout logic, KPI structure, tooltip & card stack prototype in progress
├── server.js                 ← ✅ Node.js local server
├── styles.css                ← 🎯 Contains zone styling, opacity layers, tooltip transitions, stacking animations
```

## 🎨 **VISUAL DESIGN STRATEGY**

### ✨ Current Focus: Enterprise Subtlety + Dynamic Intelligence

- Top cards should not pull focus (avoid black text or high-contrast)
    
- Interactivity should feel intuitive, not gimmicky
    
- Every interaction serves the business narrative or invites technical discussion
    
- Tooltips (implemented) evolve into stacked card logic (in progress)
    
- Card stack order reflects semantic priority (e.g., Revenue top, insight second, source third...)
    

---

## 🧪 **IN-PROGRESS: STACK-OF-CARDS PROTOTYPE (Sprint 2C)**

**Goal**: Replace static hover tooltips with a **hover or click animation** that reveals additional KPI insight cards underneath each primary KPI card.

### 🧱 Spec Highlights:

- Each KPI card becomes a stack
    
- Top card = current KPI
    
- Hover or click = slide reveals underlying cards
    
- Placeholder content okay for now
    
- Maintain opacity, soft shadows, subtle transitions (no jarring movements)
    
- CSS-only for prototype phase
    

**Approved Sprint Decision**:  
✅ Proceed with prototype — focus first on Revenue card

---

## 🧭 **STRATEGIC DECISIONS (RECENT)**

- ✅ Remove words like "Intelligence" or "Score" from KPI titles
    
- ✅ Replace ambiguous “Active Intelligence” with “Active Users”
    
- ✅ Avoid black font in Top Zone (reduces visual dominance)
    
- ✅ Shift from tooltip-only to animated card stacks for interactivity
    
- ❓ Proposed: Add “Data” menu to main nav alongside “Dashboard, Analytics, Reports, Settings”
    

---

## 📌 **OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS & DECISIONS**

|Question|Status|
|---|---|
|Should we add a **Data** tab to the top navigation?|⏳ Under consideration|
|Should card stacks expand on **hover or click**?|✅ Decided: Start with **hover**|
|Should stacks always show a fixed number of cards?|⏳ TBD — default to 3 for prototype|
|How will Copilot eventually **synthesize insights** into these cards?|⏳ Placeholder content for now|
|Will KPI stacks later support **deep links or drill-downs**?|⏳ Future milestone (deferred)|
