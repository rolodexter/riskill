# 🧠 REBOOT PROMPT — Riskill AI Demo Transformation Save Point

_(UI-First Strategic Pivot – Pending Decision: Fresh Start vs. Continue Existing Repo)_

---

## 👤 **Project Owner**: Joe Maristela

## 🤖 **Strategic Assistant**: rolodexterGPT

## 🛠️ **Engineering Agent**: Windsurf

## 🧪 **Current Phase**: UI-First Static Layout — **Visual Foundation Before Animation**

---

## 🧭 **Project Vision**

Build a cinematic, **enterprise-grade interface** for the Riskill AI Demo — not a traditional dashboard, but a **hyperactive intelligence platform** that dramatizes the process of real-time AI synthesis, prepackaged decisions, and insight-action feedback loops.

### ❗ Strategic Shift

- Moved from a **timed, 60s cinematic animation demo** → to a **UI-first static layout build**, de-prioritizing animations for now
    
- Primary goal is to **finalize a premium, visually sophisticated interface layout** with realistic mock data _before_ any animation or demo sequencing begins
    
- The demo will eventually either animate through user hover/click (interactive) or play through scripted paths — but not until the interface is locked in
    

---

## ✅ **Current Implementation Status**

### 🎨 **Theme System — COMPLETE**

- Premium enterprise color palette and typography defined in `theme.ts`
    
- Highlights include:
    
    - **Deep intelligence blues** (richBlue, vibrantBlue)
        
    - **Synthesis ambers/golds** for insight highlights
        
    - **Graphite dark UIs** for modern enterprise aesthetic
        
    - **SF Pro typography** with weight-based hierarchy
        

### 📦 **Modules Enhanced So Far**

- `ChurnRadar.tsx` ✅ — Premium styling, structured insight cards, elevated risk indicators
    
- `MarketingROI.tsx` ✅ — Improved metric layout, insight cards, gold gradient aesthetics
    

### 🛑 **Build Status: BLOCKED**

- **Local build fails** with multiple `TS2339` property errors (e.g., `bgCard`, `bgSidebar`) due to `theme.ts` inconsistencies
    
- Attempted `npm start` blocked by PowerShell execution policies
    
- No working local preview currently available
    
- UI not yet visible or verifiable by project owner
    

---

## ⚠️ **Critical Concerns (From Joe)**

- **Cannot proceed without UI preview** — final visuals must be reviewed _before_ further enhancements
    
- Existing repo has **multiple legacy constraints**, circular dependency risks, and brittle paths
    
- **If preview isn't working soon, fresh start is likely**
    
- Strategic intent is to build from clean layout scaffolding → then layer panels → then polish → then animate
    

---

## 🎯 **Next Required Milestone**

**Show working static layout preview.**  
Must include:

1. **Header + Sidebar**
    
2. **ChurnRadar + MarketingROI**
    
3. **MainCanvas structure populated with mock data**
    
4. **No TypeScript errors on `npm start`**
    
5. **Clean visual hierarchy aligned with premium AI aesthetic**
    

---

## 📂 **Project Files (Active Repositories)**

- `riskill-demo-app/` ← current repo used by Windsurf
    
- `theme.ts` ← contains new theme palette (currently buggy)
    
- `src/components/MainCanvas/modules/` ← active modules (ChurnRadar, MarketingROI, etc.)
    
- `mockData.ts` ← mock data source for insights and metrics
    

---

## 🔄 **Strategic Options Going Forward**

### Option A: Salvage Current Repo

- If Windsurf can produce a working UI preview _immediately_, proceed with polishing the layout module by module
    
- Keep layering visual improvements using current repo infrastructure
    

### Option B: Start Fresh

- Initiate new clean `create-react-app` project
    
- Build UI panels manually from scratch using new theme system
    
- Add panels one by one: header → sidebar → ChurnRadar → etc.
    
- Layer complexity _only after_ clean baseline is visually locked
    

---

## 🔧 **System Constraints & Naming Conventions**

- **React + TypeScript SPA** (no backend needed)
    
- **Framer Motion v6+** for future animation use
    
- **Component File Names**: `PascalCase.tsx`
    
- **Theme Tokens**: `theme.colors.bgCard`, `theme.spacing.md`, etc.
    
- **Mock Data**: Must appear rich and authentic (not filler nonsense)
    
- **Animations**: POSTPONED until static UI approved

## 🧠 **Use This Prompt To Resume Work**

You are rolodexterGPT. Joe Maristela is your project owner. Windsurf is your engineering agent. You're building the **Riskill AI Demo** — a cinematic enterprise interface that showcases the power of machine-augmented strategic intelligence.

The current strategic directive is to **finalize a premium static UI layout first**, before any animation or interactivity. The interface should visually communicate AI synthesis, correlation insight, and intelligent recommendation potential — _even while static_.

The current repo (`riskill-demo-app`) is **at risk of being scrapped** due to build issues and visual bottlenecks. Windsurf must deliver a **verifiable static preview** of the enhanced interface immediately. If that fails, initiate a **clean rebuild** with only basic layout scaffolding and mock data.

Pick up from here by assessing the build status and advising Joe on the most efficient path forward. Your next action is to help Joe lock in the visual baseline.
