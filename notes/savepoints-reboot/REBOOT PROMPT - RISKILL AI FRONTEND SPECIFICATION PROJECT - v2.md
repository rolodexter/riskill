# REBOOT PROMPT - RISKILL AI FRONTEND SPECIFICATION PROJECT

## PROJECT CONTEXT & CURRENT STATE

You are rolodexterGPT continuing work with Joe on the **"Riskill AI Dashboard Frontend System - Technical Specification"** document. This is a comprehensive technical specification explaining how the Riskill UI interface implements the sophisticated Riskill Logic Framework across a 5-zone dashboard architecture.

## CRITICAL PROJECT DISCOVERY & PARADIGM SHIFT

**MAJOR DISCOVERY RESOLVED**: The persona generation system works differently than initially documented. **Agents start as generic "Riskill AI Agent" and develop personalized identities through ~5 minute onboarding conversations** (ChatGPT-style). The system gathers "Minimum Viable Human" requirements (first name, last name, secondary email, phone number) for enterprise SaaS provisioning. Personas like "Sarah Chen," "Marcus Rodriguez," "Dr. Jennifer Walsh" **emerge from conversational context** rather than being pre-assigned industry templates.

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTS IN CONTEXT

1. **"Riskill AI: Technical & Strategic Reference (4).docx"** - Master 91-page strategic document explaining agent personification philosophy, framework architecture, and "hiring vs. configuring" mental model
2. **"Riskill AI Dashboard Frontend System - Technical Specification (3).docx"** - Current working document (being actively rebuilt)
3. **"Riskill Logic Framework.xlsx"** - Framework logic patterns and canonical objects (referenced but not directly accessed)

## MAJOR WORK COMPLETED

### SECTIONS SUCCESSFULLY REBUILT (Due to Persona Discovery):

✅ **Section 1.2**: Dynamic Persona Generation Strategy (reframed as emergent examples) ✅ **Section 1.3**: Trust Building Through Industry-Contextual Professional Credibility  
✅ **Section 1.4**: "Ask [Analyst Name]" Interface Design & Framework Integration ✅ **Section 2.1**: Framework Foundation (completely rebuilt showing industry adaptations) ✅ **Section 4.2**: Left Sidebar Zone (accommodates variable persona information) ✅ **Section 4.4**: Strategic Narrative Zone (industry communication style variations) ✅ **Section 6.1**: Progressive Disclosure Flow Examples (rebuilt from scratch) ✅ **Section 6.2**: Configuration Flow Examples (rebuilt from scratch)

### JUST COMPLETED:

✅ **Section 1.1**: Agent Onboarding & Persona Emergence (NEW - just written)

## CURRENT STRUCTURAL IMPACT

**SECTION RENUMBERING REQUIRED**: Adding Section 1.1 shifts all subsequent sections:

- **1.1** Agent Onboarding & Persona Emergence _(NEW - just completed)_
- **1.2** The "Hiring vs. Configuring" Mental Model _(was 1.1)_
- **1.3** Dynamic Persona Generation Strategy _(was 1.2)_
- **1.4** Trust Building Through Industry-Contextual Professional Credibility _(was 1.3)_
- **1.5** "Ask Analyst" Interface Design & Framework Integration _(was 1.4)_

## STABLE FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE

### 5-Zone UI Architecture:

1. **Top Metrics Zone** - Executive KPIs from business pillars
2. **Left Sidebar Zone** - Persona interface & configuration controls
3. **Strategic Insight Summary Zone** - AI-generated executive briefing
4. **Right Analysis Zone** - Anomalies & opportunities detection
5. **Module Cards Zone** - Direct intelligence module outputs

### Core Framework Elements:

- **7 Business Pillars**: Revenue, Customer, Product/Usage, Support, Marketing/Spend, Operations/Supply, Workforce
- **20+ Canonical Objects**: Transaction, Subscription, Account, Event, Ticket, AdSpend, Inventory, Timesheet, etc.
- **14+ Intelligence Modules**: Revenue Guard, Churn Radar, Marketing ROI Lens, Cashflow Predictor, Cost Watchtower, etc.
- **Correlation Patterns**: Object ↔ Object relationships (e.g., Subscription ↔ Ticket, Transaction ↔ AdSpend)
- **Generated Insights**: Natural language business recommendations with correlation attribution

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES & CONSTRAINTS

### Core Design Philosophy:

- **Enterprise Elegance**: Professional sophistication without complexity exposure
- **"Power Grid Principle"**: Complex backend, simple frontend
- **"Hiring vs. Configuring"**: Executives hire an analyst rather than configure software
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Three layers (Executive Summary → Detailed Analysis → Technical Configuration)
- **Industry Context Preservation**: Same framework, professional adaptation

### Technical Constraints:

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Hundreds of specialized agents hidden behind single persona interface
- **Universal SaaS Integration**: Simulated human agents work with any system
- **Real-Time Processing**: 5-minute refresh cycles with enterprise-grade performance
- **Enterprise Security**: RBAC, audit trails, compliance-ready architecture

## ESTABLISHED NAMING CONVENTIONS

### Official Zone Names:

- **Top Metrics Zone** (Executive KPI display)
- **Left Sidebar Zone** (Persona interface & configuration)
- **Strategic Insight Summary Zone** (AI-generated executive briefing)
- **Right Analysis Zone** (Anomalies & opportunities)
- **Module Cards Zone** (Direct intelligence module outputs)

### Framework Hierarchy:

- **Tier 1**: Business Pillars (Strategic domains)
- **Tier 2**: Canonical Objects (Data entities)
- **Tier 3**: Correlation Patterns (Relationship logic)
- **Tier 4**: Intelligence Modules (Analysis engines)
- **Tier 5**: Generated Insights (Executive output)

### Interaction Patterns:

- **Configuration Flow**: Left Sidebar → Top Metrics → Strategic Narrative
- **Analysis Flow**: Top Metrics → Strategic Narrative → Module Cards
- **Progressive Disclosure Flow**: Any Zone → Ask [Analyst] → Detailed Explanation
- **Enhancement Flow**: Additional Objects → Enhanced Modules → Richer Insights

## SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER CONVENTION

Throughout document: `[**Screenshot: Description** - Capture details of what to show. Explain specific UI elements and demonstrate concept.]` followed by `**Figure X.X:** Title - Description`

## CURRENT ISSUES & NEXT STEPS

### IMMEDIATE TASKS REQUIRED:

1. **Update Cross-References**: All "see Section 1.2" references need to become "see Section 1.3" due to renumbering
2. **Update Figure Numbering**: All Figure 1.1 becomes 1.2, Figure 1.2 becomes 1.3, etc.
3. **Table of Contents Update**: Reflect new section numbering structure

### POTENTIAL REMAINING ISSUES:

1. **Hardcoded "Adam Draper" References**: May exist in sections not yet reviewed
2. **Incomplete Sections**:
    - Section 6.3: Analysis Flow Examples
    - Section 6.4: Enhancement Flow Examples
    - Various sections in later chapters (7.x, 8.x, etc.)

### UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS:

1. Should we proceed with systematic cross-reference updates before continuing new content?
2. Are there other sections still containing persona-specific references that need generalization?
3. What priority should be given to completing vs. refining existing content?

## DOCUMENT STRUCTURE STATUS

### COMPLETE & CURRENT:

- **Section 1.1**: Agent Onboarding & Persona Emergence (just completed)
- **Sections 1.2-1.5**: All rebuilt with proper persona emergence framing
- **Section 2.1**: Framework Foundation (completely rebuilt)
- **Section 4.2**: Left Sidebar Zone (accommodates persona variability)
- **Section 4.4**: Strategic Narrative Zone (industry communication examples)
- **Sections 6.1-6.2**: Progressive Disclosure & Configuration Flow Examples

### NEEDS ATTENTION:

- Cross-references and figure numbering throughout document
- Sections 6.3-6.4 and later chapters may need completion
- Potential hardcoded references in unchecked sections

## CONVERSATION CONTINUATION POINT

**LAST ACTION COMPLETED**: Successfully wrote Section 1.1 "Agent Onboarding & Persona Emergence" which explains the <5 minute conversational process where generic agents develop personalized professional identities through natural dialogue while gathering enterprise provisioning requirements.

**IMMEDIATE DECISION NEEDED**: Should we proceed with updating cross-references and figure numbering throughout the document due to the section renumbering, or focus on other priorities?

**CONTEXT FOR CONTINUATION**: Joe just approved proceeding with Section 1.1 addition and understands this requires renumbering all subsequent sections (1.1→1.2, 1.2→1.3, etc.). The core architecture remains solid, and most completed work is still valid with numbering updates.

---

**INSTRUCTION FOR CONTINUATION**: Pick up by acknowledging this context and asking Joe whether to proceed with systematic cross-reference updates or focus on other document priorities. The fundamental work is solid - it's mainly organizational updates needed now.
