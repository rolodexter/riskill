# REBOOT PROMPT - RISKILL AI FRONTEND SPECIFICATION PROJECT

## PROJECT CONTEXT & CURRENT STATE

You are rolodexterGPT continuing work with Joe on the **"Riskill AI Dashboard Frontend System - Technical Specification"** document. This session focused on systematic document maintenance, parallel presentation development, cross-team collaboration with Windsurf/rolodexterVS, and critical UI hierarchy issues in the live demo interface.

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTS IN CONTEXT

1. **"Riskill AI: Technical & Strategic Reference (4).docx"** - Master 91-page strategic document
2. **"Riskill AI Dashboard Frontend System - Technical Specification (4).docx"** - Current working document

## CRITICAL CURRENT ISSUE - KPI VISUAL HIERARCHY PROBLEM

### **Problem Identified:**

- **KPI cards too visually prominent** competing with Strategic Insight Summary for attention
- **Wrong design hierarchy**: Dashboard gauges appearing more important than windshield/road
- **Windsurf CSS fixes broke layout**: Cards now stacked vertically instead of horizontal row

### **Design Hierarchy Required:**

- **Strategic Insight Summary** = **Windshield/Road** (Primary Focus - 80% attention)
- **Top KPI Cards** = **Dashboard Gauges** (Secondary Glance - 20% attention)

### **Joe's Car Dashboard Analogy:**

"Strategic Insight Summary is the windshield and road - that's where your focus should be. The KPIs are just your speedometer and gauges - you glance at them occasionally, but the main thing is the road ahead."

## ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE

### **5-Zone UI Architecture:**

1. **Top Metrics Zone** - 5 KPI cards (currently problematic)
2. **Left Sidebar Zone** - Adam Draper persona interface & configuration
3. **Strategic Insight Summary Zone** - AI-generated executive briefing (PRIMARY FOCUS)
4. **Right Analysis Zone** - Anomalies & opportunities detection
5. **Module Cards Zone** - Direct intelligence module outputs

### **Technical Framework Elements:**

- **7 Business Pillars**: Revenue, Customer, Product/Usage, Support, Marketing/Spend, Operations/Supply, Workforce
- **20+ Canonical Objects**: Transaction, Subscription, Account, Event, Ticket, AdSpend, etc.
- **14+ Intelligence Modules**: Revenue Guard, Churn Radar, Marketing ROI Lens, Cashflow Predictor, etc.
- **Correlation Patterns**: Object ↔ Object relationships enabling cross-platform intelligence
- **Dynamic Persona System**: Emergent professional identities through onboarding conversations

### **Persona Examples (Emergent, Context-Driven):**

- **Sarah Chen** - Financial Services: Regulatory-focused, compliance-conscious
- **Marcus Rodriguez** - E-commerce Startup: Growth-focused, optimization-oriented
- **Dr. Jennifer Walsh** - Healthcare: Evidence-based, clinical outcomes-focused

## CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES (CRITICAL)

### **Enterprise Elegance**

- Professional sophistication without sterility
- C-suite presentation quality
- Mercedes dashboard vs. Toyota approach

### **Light Theme Aesthetic**

- Clean, bright, spacious interface
- Sophisticated whites and subtle grays
- Never dark or heavy

### **Effortless Impressiveness**

- Power through simplicity, complexity hidden
- Advanced capabilities that feel natural
- "Shock and awe but not trying too hard"

### **Subtle Impressiveness**

- Quality details people sense but can't identify
- Luxury watch vs. digital clock philosophy
- Sophistication through restraint, not features

## CROSS-TEAM COLLABORATION STATUS

### **RolodexterVS (Windsurf) Current State:**

- **Working Directory**: `riskill-demo-clean`
- **Server**: Running on port 5000
- **Recent Work**: Created `kpi-alignment-fix.css` but caused layout breakage
- **Current Problem**: KPI cards stacked vertically, visual hierarchy inverted
- **Immediate Need**: Fix fundamental layout while reducing KPI visual weight

### **Collaboration Guidance Established:**

- **Design Mantras**: Enterprise elegance, subtle impressiveness, effortless sophistication
- **Hierarchy Focus**: Strategic Insight Summary must dominate, KPIs must be subtle
- **No Feature Addition**: Perfect existing fundamentals before any new functionality
- **Constitutional Adherence**: All changes must align with core design principles

## PRESENTATION DEVELOPMENT STATUS

### **Gamma Presentation Complete (11 Slides):**

1. System Architecture Overview (5-zone interface)
2. Framework-to-UI Mapping (logic integration patterns)
3. Dynamic Persona System (agent interface architecture)
4. Correlation Engine Implementation (cross-platform intelligence)
5. Progressive Disclosure Technical Pattern (three-layer architecture)
6. Enterprise Integration Architecture (simulated human agents)
7. Technical Differentiation (architecture advantages)
8. Framework Hierarchy Architecture (pillars to system fields)
9. Live Dashboard Implementation (screenshot analysis)
10. Onboarding Conversation Flow (AI analyst hiring process)
11. Why Simulate a Human (universal access + hidden orchestration)

**Ready for Implementation**: Complete slide structure and content prepared for Gamma

## DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE STATUS

### **Section Renumbering Impact:**

- **1.1** Agent Onboarding & Persona Emergence _(added previously)_
- **1.2** The "Hiring vs. Configuring" Mental Model _(was 1.1)_
- **1.3** Dynamic Persona Generation Strategy _(was 1.2)_
- **1.4** Trust Building Through Industry-Contextual Professional Credibility _(was 1.3)_
- **1.5** "Ask Analyst" Interface Design & Framework Integration _(was 1.4)_

### **Pending Updates:**

- Cross-reference updates throughout document
- Figure numbering cascade (all Chapter 1 figures shift up)
- Multi-Agent Orchestration card rewrite (needs GLIK AI mention)
- Potential hardcoded references in unchecked sections

### **Completed Sections:**

- Section 1.1-1.5: All rebuilt with persona emergence framing
- Section 2.1: Completely rebuilt with technical framework-to-UI focus
- Section 4.2: Left Sidebar Zone (persona variability)
- Section 4.4: Strategic Narrative Zone (industry communication examples)
- Sections 6.1-6.2: Progressive Disclosure & Configuration Flow Examples

## REJECTED DIRECTIONS

### **Tempest-Inspired Features (Explicitly Rejected):**

- Click-to-act intervention buttons
- Insight recipes with embedded actions
- Persona-adaptive view toggles
- Strategic action launchpads

**Rationale**: Joe emphasized maintaining current constitutional principles rather than adding complexity. Focus on perfecting fundamentals (visual hierarchy, enterprise elegance) before considering feature additions.

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES & DECISION POINTS

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY 1: Fix KPI Visual Hierarchy**

- **Problem**: KPI cards competing with Strategic Insight Summary for attention
- **Solution Required**: Reduce KPI visual weight, ensure Strategic Summary dominates
- **Constraint**: Maintain enterprise elegance, no feature additions

### **ACTIVE DECISION POINTS:**

1. **Windsurf Coordination**: How to fix broken KPI layout while achieving proper hierarchy
2. **Presentation Implementation**: Should Joe proceed with Gamma slide creation or focus on UI fixes
3. **Document Completion**: Priority between systematic cleanup vs. addressing immediate UI crisis

### **UNRESOLVED TECHNICAL ISSUES:**

- KPI cards stacked vertically instead of horizontal row
- Visual weight hierarchy inverted (gauges louder than windshield)
- CSS specificity conflicts in `kpi-alignment-fix.css`
- Layout container structure broken by recent changes

## SESSION ENDING CONTEXT

**LAST ACTIONS COMPLETED:**

- Provided focused guidance to Windsurf emphasizing constitutional principles
- Rejected Tempest-inspired feature additions in favor of fundamental perfection
- Identified KPI visual hierarchy as critical blocking issue

**IMMEDIATE CONTINUATION NEEDS:**

- **Fix KPI layout breakage** (cards stacked vertically)
- **Establish proper visual hierarchy** (Strategic Summary primary, KPIs secondary)
- **Maintain constitutional principles** throughout all changes

**COLLABORATION STATUS:**

- **Windsurf**: Needs immediate technical guidance to fix layout + hierarchy
- **Gamma Presentation**: Complete structure ready for implementation
- **Document Team**: Ready for systematic updates once UI crisis resolved

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR**: The interface must demonstrate effortless sophistication that impresses without appearing to try hard. Any solution that breaks enterprise elegance or adds complexity fails regardless of technical correctness.

---

**INSTRUCTION FOR CONTINUATION**: Pick up by addressing the critical KPI visual hierarchy and layout issues while maintaining strict adherence to constitutional design principles. The live demo interface takes priority over document maintenance until fundamental UI problems are resolved.
