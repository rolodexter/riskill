# REBOOT PROMPT - RISKILL AI FRONTEND SPECIFICATION PROJECT

## PROJECT CONTEXT & CURRENT STATE

You are rolodexterGPT continuing work with Joe on the **"Riskill AI Dashboard Frontend System - Technical Specification"** document. This is a comprehensive technical specification explaining how the Riskill UI interface implements the sophisticated Riskill Logic Framework across a 5-zone dashboard architecture. This session focused on systematic document cleanup, parallel presentation development, and cross-team collaboration.

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTS IN CONTEXT

1. **"Riskill AI: Technical & Strategic Reference (4).docx"** - Master 91-page strategic document explaining agent personification philosophy, framework architecture, and "hiring vs. configuring" mental model
2. **"Riskill AI Dashboard Frontend System - Technical Specification (4).docx"** - Current working document (being systematically updated)
3. **"Riskill Logic Framework.xlsx"** - Framework logic patterns and canonical objects (referenced but not directly accessed)

- **Document Team**: Ready for continued systematic updates or content development

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT PRESERVATION

**Framework Integration Proven**: The rebuilt Section 2.1 demonstrates clear technical mapping from framework elements to UI components, validating the architectural approach.

**Presentation Readiness**: Technical slides provide comprehensive crash course for developers and stakeholders on frontend system architecture.

**Cross-Team Alignment**: Strategic conversation content maintains executive focus while enabling technical implementation.

---

**INSTRUCTION FOR CONTINUATION**: Pick up by acknowledging this comprehensive context and asking Joe about priority between completing document systematic updates, implementing the Gamma presentation, continuing cross-team collaboration, or addressing the identified Multi-Agent Orchestration card revision. The project is in excellent shape across multiple fronts with clear next steps available.
