# ðŸ§  SAVE POINT REBOOT PROMPT â€” IDP-RISKILL ANOMALIES WIDGET ENHANCEMENT â€” AUGUST 4, 2025

## PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE

You are rolodexterVS (Windsurf/Cascade), working with Joe on enhancing the Anomalies widget for the IDP-Riskill dashboard. This reboot prompt captures the full working state as of August 4, 2025, at the completion of the enhanced Anomalies widget implementation, GitHub push, and Vercel deployment.

### PROJECT CONTEXT

The IDP-Riskill dashboard is a specialized visualization project featuring minimalist, elegant widgets that showcase business insights. The project includes 8 specialized widgets with ultra-minimalist design principles, including the recently enhanced Anomalies widget (formerly "Financial Anomalies").

### IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

- **COMPLETED**: Enhanced Anomalies widget with advanced animation, visualization, and interaction libraries
- **COMPLETED**: Pushed all changes to GitHub (main branch)
- **IN PROGRESS**: Deployment to Vercel/Netlify (build initiated, awaiting completion)
- **DEPLOYED URL**:Â [https://idp-riskill-dashboard.windsurf.build](https://idp-riskill-dashboard.windsurf.build/)
- **PROJECT ID**: 2e1eb71d-d01a-4247-9b12-acac8c18f902

### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

1. **Libraries Integrated**:
    
    - GSAP for animations (staggered entrance, pulse effects)
    - D3.js for micro-visualizations (sparklines)
    - Observable Plot for trend visualizations
    - Tippy.js for enhanced tooltips
    - SortableJS for drag-and-drop prioritization
    - Floating UI for context menus
2. **Key Files Modified**:
    
    - index.html: Added CDN imports and updated Anomalies widget HTML structure
    - enhanced-anomalies.jsÂ (new): Implemented all enhanced functionality with library detection
    - enhanced-anomalies.cssÂ (new): Added styles for animations, visualizations, and interactions
3. **Technical Challenges Resolved**:
    
    - Switched from ES module imports to CDN-based global variable usage
    - Moved script loading order to ensure dependencies load first
    - Implemented robust library detection and fallback mechanisms
    - Maintained minimalist design while adding advanced features

### BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS & ANALYSIS

The enhancement was informed by four business analysis documents:

- IDP Complete Business Unit Mapping Analysis
- IDP Complete Vendor Landscape Analysis
- IDP Full Customer Categorization Analysis
- IDP Product Catalog Intelligence Analysis

Key requirements included:

- Generalizing from "Financial Anomalies" to all anomaly types
- Maintaining ultra-minimalist, uncluttered UI
- Using animations/minimization to avoid increasing interface surface area
- Enabling filtering and prioritization of different anomaly types
- Preserving enterprise-grade UI/UX design principles

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- Ultra-minimalist, elegant UI with very thin lines
- Subtle color usage strictly for status indication
- Animations are purposeful, smooth, and subtle
- Visualizations are crisp, scalable SVG elements
- Progressive disclosure through tooltips and context menus
- 3D card flip animations for detailed views without cluttering the interface
