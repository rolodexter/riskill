# Maritime Dashboard Widget Enhancement Project - Reboot Prompt

## Current Project Status

We're working on enhancing the maritime dashboard widgets for the IDP Riskill platform with a focus on dark glassmorphism styling, animated data visualizations, and mode-optimized widgets (micro, compact, standard, expanded) for various business areas. We've recently implemented slider dot handle styling improvements on the Business Unit Analytics widget and created a new Team Insights widget with proper responsive behavior.

## Critical Issue

We're currently addressing a problem with missing widget pages. Several widgets are linked from the widget-index.html but don't exist as actual files:

- expenditure-tracking-widget.html
- revenue-performance-widget.html
- inventory-management-widget.html
- supply-chain-widget.html

The task at hand is to create these missing widget pages following the established design patterns and ensuring consistency with existing widgets.

## Implemented Widgets

1. Team Insights Widget - Completed with dark glassmorphism, team communication analytics, and proper slider controls
2. Business Unit Analytics Widget - Updated with improved slider dot handles but has JavaScript errors needing fixes
3. Bubble Matrix Widget - Working correctly and serving as the reference for slider UI/UX
4. Customer Analytics Widget - Exists but needs review for consistency
5. Widget Prototype (Vessel Efficiency) - Working correctly

## Project Structure

- All widget pages are in the root directory: C:\Users\rolod\OneDrive\idp-riskill-1\
- Background image: images/background.jpg
- Widget index page: widget-index.html (lists all widgets with links)
- Local development server runs on port 5177

## Widget Design Requirements

- Dark glassmorphism styling for all widgets
- Visible slider dot handles for width/height adjustments
- Four responsive modes: micro, compact, standard, expanded
- Fine-lined animated data visualizations in standard and expanded modes
- Mode-specific layouts with appropriate content density
- Maximum height of 164px for all KPI widget modes
- Consistent slider UI/UX across all widgets

## Next Steps

1. Create the missing widget pages (expenditure-tracking, revenue-performance, inventory-management, supply-chain)
2. Review all existing widget pages for consistency and completeness
3. Ensure all widgets have proper slider dot handles and responsive behavior
4. Fix JavaScript syntax errors in the Business Unit Analytics widget
