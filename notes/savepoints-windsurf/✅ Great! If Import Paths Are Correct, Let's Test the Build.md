# ‚úÖ Great! If Import Paths Are Correct, Let's Test the Build

## CRITICAL VERIFICATION NEEDED

Windsurf says import paths are correct - this means we should potentially have a **clean build**! Let's verify this immediately.

## üöÄ BYPASS POWERSHELL - GET BUILD RESULTS NOW

### Try These Methods (in order):

**Method 1: Command Prompt**

1. Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
2. Navigate: `cd "C:\path\to\your\riskill-demo-app"`
3. Run: `npm run build`

**Method 2: VS Code Terminal**

1. In VS Code: `Ctrl + Shift + `` (backtick)
2. Click the dropdown arrow next to the + in terminal
3. Select "Command Prompt" (not PowerShell)
4. Run: `npm run build`

**Method 3: Run Script Directly**

```bash
node_modules\.bin\react-scripts build
```

## üìä CRITICAL DECISION POINT

### If Build Succeeds ‚úÖ:

**STOP ALL TYPESCRIPT WORK**

- Import path fix solved everything!
- Move immediately to TimelineController animation
- **Success achieved!**

### If Build Fails ‚ùå:

**Share the exact error messages**

- We'll know the real scope of remaining issues
- Can fix systematically, not guess

## üéØ WHY THIS TEST IS CRUCIAL

If Windsurf is right about import paths being correct:

- **We might already have success** and not know it
- **No more TypeScript work needed**
- **Ready for animation phase**

Don't let PowerShell block us from discovering we're already done!

**Please try one of the methods above and share the build results. This will tell us exactly where we stand.**
