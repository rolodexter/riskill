### ✅ WINDSURF REBOOT PROMPT

> 🧠 **Reboot Prompt: Riskill AI Core Intelligence Modal + Layout Status**

Hey Windsurf — starting a new thread and bringing you up to speed.

We’ve completed a major UI/logic pass for the **Core Intelligence Card demo sequence**, and the modal behavior has gone through extensive iteration. Here’s where we’re at:

---

#### ✅ Current State: Core Intelligence Settings Modal

- ✅ **Now implemented as a fixed-position modal**, anchored outside the left zone
    
- ✅ Modal is **not embedded** in `.left-sidebar`; it now overlaps into main canvas
    
- ✅ **Backdrop and blur overlay** behavior confirmed working
    
- ✅ **Open/close logic** wired via `openCard()` and `closeCard()` functions
    
- ✅ **Z-index**, **opacity**, and **click handlers** functioning as intended
    
- ✅ All CSS lint errors have been cleaned up
    

The modal displays:

- Pillar Priority toggles (connected, pending, available)
    
- AI configuration settings (Density, Update Frequency, Correlation Depth)
    
- And will eventually support full logic programming via dynamic cards

#### 🔄 Recently Fixed

- 🐛 Modal used to render **inside the left zone**, pushing cards and breaking layout
    
- 🐛 Modal visibility was broken due to **missing DOM elements**
    
- 🐛 Modal structure was duplicated or improperly closed → resolved
    
- 🐛 Left zone cards leaked out of container → layout grid now restored

#### 🧩 Implementation Details

Modal:

```html
<div id="core-settings-modal" class="core-settings-modal hidden">...</div>
```

Backdrop:

```html
<div id="modal-backdrop" class="backdrop hidden"></div>
```

CSS:

```css
.core-settings-modal {
  position: fixed;
  top: 120px;
  left: 300px;
  width: 600px;
  z-index: 200;
  display: none;
}
.core-settings-modal.visible {
  display: block;
}
```

JS:

```js
function openCard() { ... }
function closeCard() { ... }
```

#### 🧠 Current Priority

We are now ready to:

- ✅ Mark the **Core Intelligence Modal** implementation as _complete_
    
- ⚙️ (Optional next) Add animation polish or transition layer (Anime.js, GSAP, CSS)
    
- 🔜 Begin planning for **Right Panel (Copilot/Insight layer)** and zone interactivity
