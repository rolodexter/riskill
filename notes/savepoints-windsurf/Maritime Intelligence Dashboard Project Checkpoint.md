# Maritime Intelligence Dashboard Project Checkpoint

## Project Overview

- **Project:** Maritime Intelligence Dashboard
- **Technologies:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
- **Theme:** Onyx dark with glassmorphism effects
- **Core Focus:** Implementing fully automated, responsive, zone-aware sizing and layout for all dashboard widgets

## Current Project State

We have successfully implemented a responsive dashboard with the following zones:

1. **Header KPI Row:** 5 responsive KPI cards with dynamic sizing based on importance
2. **Left Sidebar Panel:** Vessel and fleet management information
3. **Main Content Panel:** Primary dashboard content
4. **Right Panel:** Anomalies (top) and Opportunities (bottom) with dynamic height distribution
5. **Module Row:** 6 horizontal modules (Fleet Status, Navigation, Performance, Weather, Security, Communications)

## Recent Accomplishments

- Implemented fully automated responsive sizing for all dashboard zones
- Fixed right panel to dynamically distribute space between Anomalies and Opportunities
- Converted bottom Module Row from vertical stacking to proper horizontal layout
- Added intelligent width distribution algorithm to both KPI row and Module row
- Enhanced animations with staggered entrance effects

## Current Implementation Details

- All dashboard zones use grid-area assignments for reliable positioning
- Each zone now leverages a ResponsiveWidget component variant suited to its content type
- KPI widgets and Module cards dynamically size based on available space and priority
- Right panel intelligently allocates vertical space between components
- Container-based responsive design using ResizeObserver

## File Structure Highlights

- DashboardLayout.tsx: Main grid container with zone positioning
- DashboardSections.tsx: Individual section components with responsive behavior
- ResponsiveKPIWidget.tsx, 
    
    ResponsiveContentWidget.tsx, etc.: Zone-specific components
- useResponsiveContainer.ts: Hook for container size detection

## Working Features

- Four content density levels (micro, minimal, compact, full)
- Smart adaptive layout with progressive disclosure
- Automated widget sizing based on container dimensions
- Zone-aware content rendering optimized for available space
- Animations and microinteractions with Framer Motion

## In-Progress Work

- Enhancing the zone-aware responsive sizing systems
- Making all widgets fully adaptive to container width
- Improving module row's horizontal layout presentation

All sections of the dashboard now properly use zone-aware responsive containers with dynamic content sizing. The system intelligently adjusts content density based on available space, providing an enterprise-grade data visualization experience that adapts seamlessly across all device sizes.
