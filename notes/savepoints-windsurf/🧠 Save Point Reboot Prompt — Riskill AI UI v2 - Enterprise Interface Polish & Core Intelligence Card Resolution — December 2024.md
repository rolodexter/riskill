## 🚨 **CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE & IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**

### **Core Intelligence Status Card - Modal Display Bug**

**Problem Description**:

- Card located in left sidebar displaying "Core Intelligence Status" with progress visualization
- Click functionality triggers modal overlay (screen blurs correctly)
- Settings menu HTML structure exists but fails to display
- Modal overlay dismisses correctly but settings interface never appears
- **Strategic Goal**: Implement elegant 3D card flip animation revealing settings on card back

**Expected Behavior Specification**:

- Click Core Intelligence Status card → Smooth 3D flip animation
- Card back reveals comprehensive settings interface for left zone customization
- Settings provide user control over canonical object visibility and AI preferences
- Demonstrates user-driven customization complementing AI-driven insights
- Card expands appropriately to accommodate all settings without cramping

**Technical Context**:

- Modal overlay JavaScript functioning (blur effect confirms event handling)
- Settings menu HTML structure confirmed present in DOM
- Z-index and visibility logic failing - settings div not rendering
- Card flip CSS animation framework needs implementation
- Modal overlay and click-outside dismiss working correctly

### **Required Implementation Approach**:

```css
/* 3D Card Flip Animation Specification */
.core-intelligence-status {
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  transition: transform 0.6s ease-in-out;
  position: relative;
}

.core-intelligence-status.flipped {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}

.card-front, .card-back {
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.card-back {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
  padding: 20px;
  /* Settings interface content */
}
```
