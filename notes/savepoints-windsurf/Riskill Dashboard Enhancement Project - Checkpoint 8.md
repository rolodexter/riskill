# Riskill Dashboard Enhancement Project - Checkpoint 8

## Project Overview

We are enhancing the Riskill dashboard for IDP with enterprise-grade features, focusing on KPI widgets. The dashboard uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a clean, modern UI featuring glassmorphism and a three-zone layout. We've completed Phase 1 (visual sophistication) and Phase 2 (interactive depth) of the KPI widget enhancements, and are preparing to push these changes to GitHub and deploy to Vercel.

2. **Short-term**:
    
    - Continue performance optimizations and error handling improvements
    - Implement Phase 3: Enterprise integration signals (benchmarks, data lineage, compliance badges)
    - Implement Phase 4: Actionable intelligence (thresholds, anomaly detection, AI recommendations)
3. **Long-term**:
    
    - Consider enhancements for IDP's workflow automation needs
    - Revisit Automated Reporting and Enhanced SQL Interface features

## User Preferences

- Prefers minimalistic, professional UI with clear distinction between user and AI
- Values performance, memory management, and error handling
- Appreciates subtle animations and refined typography
- Wants enterprise-grade features that impress clients

## Technical Context

- Dashboard uses plain HTML, CSS, JS with Phosphor Icons
- Uses React/Recharts for some visualizations
- Features glassmorphism UI with three-zone layout
- KPI widgets serve as quick-glance indicators with added context

We're ready to stage, commit, and push our changes to GitHub, then deploy to Vercel to make the enhanced dashboard live.
