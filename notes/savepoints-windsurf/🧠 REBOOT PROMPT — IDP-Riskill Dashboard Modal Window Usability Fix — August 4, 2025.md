# ðŸ§  REBOOT PROMPT â€” IDP-Riskill Dashboard Modal Window Usability Fix â€” August 4, 2025

## Project Context

You are working on the IDP-Riskill dashboard, a specialized visualization project featuring minimalist, elegant UI design. The project includes 8 specialized widgets including Mega-Project Performance Monitor, Business Unit Revenue Comparison, Customer Segment Analysis, and others. The most recent task was fixing a usability issue with modal windows.

## Recently Completed Task

You successfully implemented a fix for the data source modal windows that previously could only be closed by refreshing the page. The implemented solution:

1. Added an event listener to close modals when clicking outside the modal content
2. Utilized the existing close (X) button functionality
3. Maintained the project's ultra-minimalist design principles

The code change was minimal and focused on theÂ 

index.htmlÂ file, adding an event listener to the modal overlay:

javascript

// Close modal when clicking outside modal content  
modalOverlay.addEventListener('click', function(event) {  
    if (event.target === modalOverlay) {  
        modalOverlay.classList.remove('active');  
    }  
});

## Current Project Status

- Changes have been successfully committed to GitHub with the message "Fix modal close functionality for data sources - add close on outside click"
- The commit has been pushed to the main branch
- A local test server was set up (http-server on port 3000) to verify functionality
- The deployment toÂ [https://idp-riskill-dashboard.windsurf.build](https://idp-riskill-dashboard.windsurf.build/)Â was attempted but showed "site can't be reached"

## Current Files and Structure

- index.html: Contains the main dashboard interface including the data source modals
- styles-additions.css: Contains the modal styling includingÂ 
    
    ```
    .modal-overlay
    ```
    
    Â andÂ 
    
    ```
    .sql-modal
    ```
    
    Â classes
- ```
    anomalies-widget.css
    ```
    
    : Previously modified for the Anomalies widget rebuild
- scripts.js: Contains event handling for the dashboard

## Pending Tasks

- Test the modal behavior on the deployed site once deployment issues are resolved
- The local preview confirmed the functionality works as expected

## Design Constraints and Requirements

- Ultra-minimalist, elegant UI with very thin lines
- Subtle color usage strictly for status indication
- No generic icons or UI elements
- Widget content contained within boundaries

## Technical Details

- Framework: NextJS
- Project ID: 2e1eb71d-d01a-4247-9b12-acac8c18f902
- GitHub repo is synced with the latest changes
- Deployment windsurf ID: 105ec1ff-58e6-4bff-9692-35a60020a149

## Next Steps

The next priority is to resolve the deployment issue to ensure the modal fix is available on the live site. Alternatively, we could proceed with other dashboard enhancements or bug fixes once this deployment is confirmed working.
