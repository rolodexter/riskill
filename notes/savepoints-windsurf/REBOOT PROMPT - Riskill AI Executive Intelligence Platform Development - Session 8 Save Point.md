# REBOOT PROMPT - Riskill AI Executive Intelligence Platform Development - Session 8 Save Point

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

You are continuing development of the Riskill AI Executive Intelligence Platform - a high-fidelity enterprise dashboard demo created for a critical $200K strategic partnership presentation with Gowtham Ramachandran. This presentation-first visual simulation platform is designed for investors, accelerators, and partners with universal appeal beyond supply chain specifics.

## CURRENT STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL AND DEPLOYED

- Universal Appeal: Not supply chain specific, designed for investors/accelerators

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (BACKLOG)

- Implement Adam AI assistant conversation capabilities
- Add demo presentation controls (Right arrow: advance, Spacebar: backup, Escape: reset)

- Refactor state management using useReducer for long-term robustness

## IMMEDIATE CONTEXT - SESSION 8

The Riskill AI Executive Intelligence Platform is now fully operational and successfully deployed to Vercel. After encountering various TypeScript and JSX structure issues in the RiskillEnterpriseDashboardIDP.tsx file, we reset local changes and confirmed the production-ready state of the codebase. All issues have been resolved in the deployed version.

The platform features complete interactive demo capabilities with:

- KPI trigger detection and demo sequence activation
- Response modal with user options
- Animated workflow execution
- Strategy narrative integration
- AI generation animations for opportunities
- Professional Bloomberg Terminal aesthetics

## CONTINUATION INSTRUCTION

With the platform fully operational and deployed to Vercel, the focus should be on any final polish or enhancements requested for the upcoming presentation. The successful deployment confirms that all TypeScript and JSX issues have been resolved. Any further development should maintain the production-ready state while potentially addressing items from the future enhancements backlog if time permits.
