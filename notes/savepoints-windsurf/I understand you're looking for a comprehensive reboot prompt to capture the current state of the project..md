I'm working on enhancing the Riskill Demo application UI and need to continue where we left off. Here's the current state:

PROJECT: Riskill Demo UI Enhancement
DATE: July 16, 2025

COMPLETED TASKS:
1. Rebuilt the left zone UI:
   - Removed all original content and created a clean wireframe area
   - Applied gradient background suitable for settings/control panel
   - Added four placeholder cards with elegant styling ("Settings", "Controls", "Filters", "Preferences")
   - Implemented drag-and-drop functionality using Sortable.js
   - Removed colored status trim from cards
   - Used lighter, smaller fonts for a more streamlined look

2. Enhanced overall UI compactness and elegance:
   - Reduced padding throughout the interface (header: 10px/20px → 6px/16px)
   - Optimized content grid (height: 150px → 120px, padding: 10px → 8px)
   - Reduced left zone padding (10px → 8px) and card spacing (16px → 12px)
   - Made left cards more compact (padding: 16px → 12px, min-height: 120px → 110px)

3. Updated module cards in lower zone:
   - Made module names all caps, smaller (11px), and bolder (600 weight)
   - Reduced module title size (16px → 14px) and made more compact
   - Decreased module insight text size (14px → 13px) and line height (1.5 → 1.4)
   - Created more streamlined, enterprise-elegant appearance

4. Other UI improvements:
   - Removed search field and username from upper right corner
   - Applied subtle gradients throughout for enterprise elegance
   - Ensured minimalist, clean aesthetic across all elements
