# Riskill AI UI v2 Project Continuation

I'm working on the Riskill AI UI v2 project and need to continue where we left off. Here's the current state:

## Project Overview
- React TypeScript UI with professional dark theme
- Five main zones: Header (~80px), Left Sidebar (~250px), Main Canvas (central), Right Panel (~300px), Bottom Zone (~200px)
- Main Canvas showcases "Impossible Correlations" through narrative intelligence cards
- Right Panel (Copilot zone) has been emptied and is ready for rebuild

## Recent Accomplishments
1. Enhanced narrative cards with refined styling for "Enterprise Elegance" and "Subtle Impressiveness"
   - Subtle gradient backgrounds, refined shadows, increased padding, blur effects
   - Improved hover effects for subtle elevation
   - Refined confidence badges with softer gradients and improved typography
   - Enhanced data source tags with delicate backgrounds and smooth transitions
2. Removed puzzle piece icons from module tags for cleaner design
3. Implemented color-coded module tags synchronized with left sidebar pillars:
   - Growth Pulse: Blue
   - Margin Multiplier: Green
   - Expansion Engine: Red
   - Churn Radar: Orange
   - Customer Sentinel: Purple
   - Efficiency Lens: Teal
   - Cost Watchtower: Brown
   - Marketing ROI: Violet
   - Escalation Radar: Pink
4. Replaced generic "Feature X" with concrete "Risk Predictor" feature in the Growth Opportunity card

## Current Focus
- Main Canvas narrative cards have been polished with elegant styling
- Ready to define and implement the new UI/UX layout for the Right Panel (Copilot zone)

## Next Steps
- Define new UI/UX layout for the right panel based on provided content
- Implement new right panel HTML structure
- Integrate logic to display Copilot conversation and analysis results

## Design Principles
- Enterprise Elegance: Sophisticated, professional appearance
- Subtle Impressiveness: Clean, uncluttered design with thoughtful visual hierarchy
- Visual Consistency: Color synchronization between related elements

Let's continue by planning the rebuild of the Right Panel (Copilot zone).
