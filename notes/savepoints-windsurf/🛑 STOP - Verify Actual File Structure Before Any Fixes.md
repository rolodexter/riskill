# 🛑 STOP - Verify Actual File Structure Before Any Fixes

## WINDSURF IS CONTRADICTING EARLIER STATEMENTS

**Earlier Windsurf said:** Import paths `../../../data/mockData` are correct  
**Now Windsurf says:** Should be `../../../data/mockData` but components are using `../../../mockData`

## 🔍 DEFINITIVE VERIFICATION NEEDED

Before making ANY changes, please verify these exact facts:

### Step 1: Confirm File Location

**Open File Explorer and navigate to your project folder**

- Is there a file at: `src/mockData.ts` ✅ or ❌
- Is there a file at: `src/data/mockData.ts` ✅ or ❌
- Screenshot or list the actual file structure

### Step 2: Confirm Component Import Statements

**Open one module component (like ChurnRadar.tsx) and check:**

- What does the import line actually say?
- `import { churnRadarData } from '../../../data/mockData';` ✅ or ❌
- `import { churnRadarData } from '../../../mockData';` ✅ or ❌

## 🚫 DO NOT MAKE CHANGES YET

**Windsurf seems confused about:**

- Where the file actually is
- What the components are actually importing
- What the "correct" path should be

## 📊 FACTS BEFORE FIXES

Once we have the definitive file structure and import statements, we can make **one targeted fix** instead of guessing.
