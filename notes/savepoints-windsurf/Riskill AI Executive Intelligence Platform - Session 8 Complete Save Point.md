## Key Technical Implementations

### Mobile Responsiveness Architecture

- **Font Scaling System**: Granular responsive typography using Tailwind breakpoints
    - Extra Small (< 475px):Â 
        
        ```
        text-[10px]
        ```
        
        ,Â 
        
        ```
        text-xs
        ```
        
    - Small (475px+):Â 
        
        ```
        text-xs
        ```
        
        ,Â 
        
        ```
        text-sm
        ```
        
    - Medium (640px+):Â 
        
        ```
        text-sm
        ```
        
        ,Â 
        
        ```
        text-base
        ```
        
    - Large (768px+):Â 
        
        ```
        text-lg
        ```
        
        ,Â 
        
        ```
        text-xl
        ```
        

### Widget Layout System

- **Right Side Container**: Anomalies and Opportunities in vertical stack
- **Desktop Layout**: Side-by-side widgets in 3-column container
- **Mobile Layout**: Vertical stacking with proper order (Anomalies â†’ Opportunities)

### Touch Scrolling Solution

- **Main Container**:Â 
    
    ```
    overflow-auto
    ```
    
    Â with mobile-specific CSS
    - ```
        WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'
        ```
        
    - ```
        touchAction: 'pan-y'
        ```
        
    - ```
        overscrollBehavior: 'contain'
        ```
        
- **Event Handler Logic**: Mobile detection usingÂ 
    
    ```
    'ontouchstart' in window
    ```
    
- **Scroll Interference Prevention**: Desktop-only event interception

### Routing Configuration

- **React Router**: Multi-version support (
    
    ```
    /
    ```
    
    ,Â 
    
    ```
    /minimalist
    ```
    
    ,Â 
    
    ```
    /idp
    ```
    
    )
- **Vercel Configuration**:Â 
    
    vercel.jsonÂ with proper SPA rewrites

## Critical File Modifications

- **Primary Component**:Â 
    
    src/components/RiskillEnterpriseDashboardMinimalist.tsx
    - Mobile responsiveness improvements
    - Widget separation and positioning
    - Font scaling implementation
    - Touch scrolling fixes
    - Layout spacing optimization
- **Routing Setup**:Â 
    
    ```
    src/App.tsx
    ```
    
    Â with React Router configuration
- **Deployment Config**:Â 
    
    vercel.jsonÂ for client-side routing support

## Recent Problem-Solving Sequence

1. **Widget Positioning Issue**: Fixed Opportunities widget appearing on wrong side
2. **TypeScript Build Failure**: Removed unusedÂ 
    
    ```
    newActivities
    ```
    
    Â variable
3. **404 Routing Error**: Added vercel.json configuration
4. **Mobile Touch Scrolling**: Comprehensive fix with CSS and event handler modifications
5. **Layout Spacing**: Reduced gap between KPI widgets and main content (24px â†’ 8px)

## Design Decisions and Constraints
