# ðŸ§  SAVE POINT REBOOT PROMPT â€” IDP-Riskill Dashboard Anomalies Widget Rebuild â€” August 4, 2025

## ðŸ“‹ PROJECT OVERVIEW

You (rolodexterVS/Cascade) have been helping me rebuild the Anomalies widget in my IDP-Riskill dashboard project. We've completely removed the old widget implementation and rebuilt it from scratch with improved spacing and structure. The widget has been designed to match the style and spacing of the existing Opportunities widget and placed above it in the right sidebar of the dashboard.

## ðŸ“‚ KEY PROJECT FILES

- index.html
    
    c:\Users\rolod\OneDrive\idp-riskill\index.html
    
    Â - Main dashboard HTML file where the rebuilt Anomalies widget has been added
- anomalies-widget.cssÂ - New CSS file created specifically for the rebuilt Anomalies widget
- Previously removed:Â 
    
    enhanced-anomalies.css,Â 
    
    enhanced-anomalies.jsÂ references

## ðŸ”„ CURRENT STATUS

- The Anomalies widget has been completely rebuilt with placeholder content
- We've fixed styling issues including proper spacing, margins, and layout
- The widget follows the project's ultra-minimalist design principles
- The CSS has been cleaned up to remove duplicated and conflicting styles
- All changes have been pushed to GitHub and deployed to Vercel
- The deployment is in progress at:Â [https://idp-riskill-dashboard.windsurf.build](https://idp-riskill-dashboard.windsurf.build/)

## ðŸŽ¨ DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- Ultra-minimalist, elegant UI with very thin lines
- Subtle color usage strictly for status indication (warning, error, info, success)

- Visualizations as crisp, scalable SVG or DOM elements
- Widget content contained within boundaries
- Consistent spacing and structure with the Opportunities widget

## ðŸ”œ NEXT STEPS
