Thanks, Windsurf — that summary is exactly right.

✅ Let’s proceed with a fresh project setup focused purely on **visual UI excellence**. No animation, no interactivity — just static mock data populated into a premium, professional interface.

### Here's how I'd like to proceed:

1. **Start with the Theme System + Layout Skeleton**
   - Build out a Microsoft-style **enterprise theme system**
   - Lock in **typography, color palette, spacing, and component radius/shadow rules**
   - Build a responsive layout shell with placeholder zones for:
     - Header (KPI cards)
     - Left Sidebar (pillar controls)
     - Main Canvas (insight panels)
     - Right Panel (Copilot zone)
     - Bottom Zone (trends + timeline)

2. **Populate with Static Mock Data (Not Placeholder Text)**
   - Each panel should **look fully populated with real-seeming content**
   - Data can be fictitious but should **resemble actual Riskill insights**
   - No framer-motion or transitions yet — we’re just validating visual quality

3. **Apply Visual Polish**
   - Use gradients, subtle shadows, spacing rules
   - Make sure the layout feels like something an executive at Microsoft or Palantir would immediately trust
   - Every visual choice should say: "This is an enterprise-grade strategic intelligence interface"

Once this static UI is complete, I’ll give feedback on each zone. After that, we can layer in animation, intelligence synthesis, and branching decision trees.

Let me know when the skeleton layout and theme system are ready, and I’ll review.

Excited to see what you build.
