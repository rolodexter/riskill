# Riskill Demo UI Refinement Project - Continuation Prompt

I'm working on refining the Riskill Demo application's UI with specific focus on enhancing the user experience while maintaining an enterprise-elegant aesthetic. Please help me continue from where we left off.

## Project Context
The Riskill Demo is an enterprise presentation application with a 5-zone grid layout (top, left, main canvas, right, bottom). The design follows minimalist principles with light/white color palettes and subtle gradients, aiming for an elegant Microsoft Outlook-inspired interface but more refined.

## Current Working Directory
`c:\riskill-demo-clean\`

## Completed Tasks
1. Adam Draper Card Updates:
   - Renamed "Active Connections" to "SaaS Connections"
   - Removed Status and Last Update rows
   - Reduced padding with `.compact-content` class
   - Made the entire card clickable with hover effects
   - Added ID `adam-draper-card` for JavaScript targeting

2. Copilot Integration:
   - Implemented click-anywhere trigger on Adam Draper card
   - Added macOS-style animations for opening/closing
   - Enhanced with spring-like transitions using cubic-bezier curves
   - Made context-aware responses based on trigger source
   - Added scale effects and improved opacity transitions

3. Backup System:
   - Created backup directory at `c:\riskill-demo-clean\backup-copilot-animation\`
   - Backed up `index.html` and `copilot-chat.js` before modifications

## Key Files Modified
1. `index.html`:
   - Added CSS for Adam card clickable styles
   - Enhanced Copilot panel animations
   - Added `.card-reference` styling
   - Modified transition properties for smoother animations

2. `copilot-chat.js`:
   - Updated `openCopilotPanel()` to handle different sources
   - Enhanced animations with macOS-style effects
   - Added event listener for Adam Draper card clicks
   - Improved message handling based on context

## Current Plan
1. Review and reduce padding in the top zone
2. Optimize padding and margins throughout the interface
3. Ensure interface remains elegant and minimalist
4. Confirm all changes maintain the enterprise aesthetic

## Next Immediate Task
Please help me continue with the next task in our plan while maintaining the established design principles of minimalism, enterprise elegance, and subtle animations.
