- Borders: Multi-directional with varying opacity (10% main, 15% top, 8% left)
- Shadows: Advanced shadow system with multiple layers and 3D depth effects
- Professional spacing preventing overlap with consistent 144px widget heights
- Response modal styling consistent with platform aesthetic using same glassmorphism approach

## CURRENT COMPONENT STATE - SESSION 8

### Key State Variables:

typescript

const [kpiOrder, setKpiOrder] = useState(['revenue', 'churn', 'coordination', 'risk', 'performance'])  
const [currentRevenueCard, setCurrentRevenueCard] = useState(0)  
const [currentKpiCards, setCurrentKpiCards] = useState([0, 0, 0, 0])  
  
// Demo sequence state  
const [isDemoSequenceActive, setIsDemoSequenceActive] = useState(false)  
const [showResponseModal, setShowResponseModal] = useState(false)  
const [emailTaskStatus, setEmailTaskStatus] = useState('')  
const [emailTaskProgress, setEmailTaskProgress] = useState(0)  
  
// Opportunities widget with AI generation animations  
const [currentOpportunity, setCurrentOpportunity] = useState(0)  
const [isGeneratingOpportunity, setIsGeneratingOpportunity] = useState(false)  
const [opportunityTypewriterText, setOpportunityTypewriterText] = useState('')  
const [showOpportunityMetrics, setShowOpportunityMetrics] = useState(false)  
const [opportunityAnimationPhase, setOpportunityAnimationPhase] = useState<'thinking' | 'typing' | 'revealing' | 'complete'>('complete')  
  
// Adam AI Agent state  
const [adamActivities, setAdamActivities] = useState([...8 realistic business activities...])  
const [adamTasks, setAdamTasks] = useState([...3 tasks with progress bars...])

### Demo Sequence Functions:

- handleDemoResponse(response: 'go-ahead' | 'hold-off' | 'chat'): Processes user response selection
- startEmailTaskExecution(): Initiates animated workflow with sequential status updates
- getCurrentNarrative(): Returns appropriate narrative content based on demo state
- handleNarrativeAction(action: string): Handles Strategy Narrative Center action buttons

### Widget Data Structure:

- **Revenue:** 4-card carousel with revenue metrics, growth trends, forecasts
- **Churn:** 3-card stack with churn rate, at-risk customers, retention strategies
- **Coordination:** 3-card stack with meetings, emails, Slack/Teams collaboration (EMAILS card triggers demo)
- **Risk:** 3-card stack with risk scores, threats, mitigation coverage
- **Performance:** 3-card stack with uptime, throughput, system efficiency
- **Opportunities:** 4-card stack with business opportunities (AI generation animations enabled)

## SIMULATED HUMAN AGENT ARCHITECTURE - CORE CONCEPT

### "Minimum Viable Human" Approach:

- Exactly the profile depth required for legitimate enterprise SaaS provisioning
- Name, email, department, title, phone (for 2FA)
- Avoids personal backstories, anthropomorphic behaviors, emotional expressions

### Dynamic Persona Generation:

- Agents start as generic "Riskill AI Agent"
- Develop personalized identities through ~5-minute onboarding conversations
- Context-driven emergence (Adam Draper, Sarah Chen, Marcus Rodriguez, Dr. Jennifer Walsh)

### Universal SaaS Compatibility:

- Simulated human agents navigate any platform as legitimate users
- Solves API integration complexity problem
- Gets provisioned like any employee with proper permissions

### Technical Advantage:

**Traditional Approach:** Complex API integrations + permission headaches **Riskill Approach:** "Hire" AI analyst → Gets user account → Works everywhere

## DEMO PRESENTATION STRATEGY

**Universal Appeal:** Designed for investors/accelerators/partners, not supply chain specific **Living Intelligence System:** Continuous animations show platform never sleeps **Interactive Demo Flow:** Complete KPI → Adam → Action sequence for dynamic presentations **Professional Polish:** Bloomberg Terminal-level sophistication with enhanced opportunities widget **Narrative Flow:** "Meet Adam, your new AI business analyst" - showcases universal deployment **Presenter Control:** Clean opportunities summaries and demo sequence allow controlled narrative flow

## DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
