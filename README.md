# Riskill AI - Cinematic Adaptive Banking Interface

A highly cinematic, adaptive AI interface for the banking/financial services vertical. This project creates a presentation-quality demo showcasing adaptive UI behaviors through simulated animations and storyboarded user journeys, with special focus on agent onboarding and persona emergence.

## Project Vision

Riskill AI simulates an adaptive interface that responds to user behavior in real-time, presenting financial data and insights through a sleek, cinematic glassmorphic UI inspired by Bloomberg Terminal, Palantir Foundry, and Vision Pro overlays. The interface demonstrates how an AI agent evolves from a generic assistant to a specialized banking/financial services persona through conversational onboarding.

## Key Features

- **Simulated Agent Onboarding**: Conversational UI that demonstrates persona emergence
- **Scene-Based Navigation**: Smooth transitions between welcome, onboarding, and dashboard scenes
- **Glassmorphic UI Components**: Dark, transparent cards with subtle highlights and depth
- **Adaptive Animation Sequences**: Storyboarded scenes demonstrating UI adaptation
- **Financial Data Visualization**: Banking metrics, risk analysis, and client retention insights
- **Cinematic Effects**: Particle systems, focus transitions, and dramatic reveals

## Technology Stack

- React with TypeScript
- Framer Motion for component animations
- GSAP for complex timeline animations
- ApexCharts for data visualization (planned)
- Tippy.js for enhanced tooltips (planned)
