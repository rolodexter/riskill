### Completed
- Implemented SceneController for unified navigation between scenes
  - Created navigation controls with smooth transitions between interface states
  - Added persistent UI controls for demo navigation
- Implemented WelcomeScene as the entry point
  - Added cinematic intro with particle effects and clear call-to-action
  - Provided pathways to start demo or enter onboarding flow
- Implemented AgentOnboardingScene for persona emergence storytelling
  - Created conversational UI simulating chatbot onboarding
  - Implemented progressive persona emergence based on MVH data collection
  - Added visual feedback for industry selection and persona crystallization
- Fixed App.tsx implementation to use SceneController as main entry point
  - Resolved syntax errors and cleaned up implementation
  - Simplified app structure for better maintainability

### In Progress
- Further integration of Simulated Human Agent Architecture concepts into onboarding flow
- Enhancing scene transitions and narrative coherence between scenes

### Next Steps
1. Further enhance agent persona emergence animations and storytelling
2. Improve dashboard handoff from onboarding to show personalized insights
3. Prepare project for GitHub push and deployment

## 2025-08-08 - Advanced UI Components and Scene Implementation

### Completed
- Integrated ApexCharts for financial data visualizations
  - Created `FinancialChart` component with dynamic, responsive charts
  - Added area charts with multiple series and custom styling
- Implemented Tippy.js tooltips for enhanced interactivity
  - Created reusable `Tooltip` component with glassmorphic styling
  - Added detailed contextual tooltips to metric values and trends
- Integrated GSAP animation timelines
  - Created `TransitionEffects.ts` utility with reusable animation timelines
  - Implemented reveal, focus, scene transition, and parallax animations
- Built `DashboardReveal` scene with cinematic animations
  - Created parallax effects and sequential animations
  - Combined all components into a cohesive dashboard experience
- Updated documentation (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) to reflect new components

### In Progress
- Development of additional scenes for the adaptive UI walkthrough
- Integration testing of all animation timelines and components

### Next Steps
1. Create additional scenes for the storyboard sequence
2. Implement control panel for navigating between scenes
3. Add responsive behavior for different screen sizes
4. Enhance animation sequences with more microinteractions

### Technical Notes
- Successfully resolved React 18 type issues with Tippy.js
- GSAP animations are working smoothly with React refs
- ApexCharts successfully integrated into GlassmorphicCard components

## 2025-08-07 - Project Migration and Organization

### Completed
- Migrated core components to the proper riskill repository structure
- Created self-orienting documentation (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, WORKLOG.md)
- Updated README.md with comprehensive project information
- Aligned folder structure with existing repository organization
- Set up development server in the correct repository
- Fixed import paths and restored missing files (index.html, main.tsx)

### Technical Notes
- Successfully addressed import path issues after migration
- Fixed React import lint errors in App.tsx
- Created proper entry points for Vite build system

## 2025-08-07 - Initial Setup and Core Components

### Completed
- Created project using Vite with React and TypeScript
- Installed key dependencies: Framer Motion, GSAP
- Implemented `GlassmorphicCard` component with glassmorphic styling
- Created `BankingMetricCard` component for financial metrics
- Set up basic demo App with interactive card components
- Established dark, cinematic aesthetic with particle system

### Technical Decisions
- Using Framer Motion for component-level animations
- GSAP for complex timelines and scene transitions
- ApexCharts for financial data visualizations
- Tippy.js for enhanced tooltip interactions
- Glassmorphic UI style for depth and visual hierarchy
- Inline styles currently used for rapid prototyping; will be refactored to separate style files
- Focusing on modular component architecture for reusability
